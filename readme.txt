== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin require a multisite installation? =

No it works on both a single install and multisite

= Why are the last login dates and login numbers different in the users screen in the network and site admins? =

In the network user screen the last login dates apply across the network, whereas in the single site admin the date is the last time the user logged into that site and the number is the number of times the user logged in to that site

= What is something does not work?  =

LH Login Logger, and all [https://lhero.org](LocalHero) plugins are made to WordPress standards. Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones). 

If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfirteen, twentysixteen etc.

If the problem persists please leave a post in the support forum: [https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-login-logger/](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-login-logger/). I look there regularly and resolve most queries.
